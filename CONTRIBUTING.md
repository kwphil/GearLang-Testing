# Contributing to GearLang

Contributing will always be a huge help for us. Here are the guidelines!

## Got a question or problem?

RESOURCES at [the docs](doc) might help you (WARNING: there isn't a lot).

If you have further questions that the docs won't tell you, you can be redirected to one of my accounts:

[GitHub](https://www.github.com/kwphil) \
[E-Mail](phillips1980@gmail.com) \
[Reddit (if you must)](https://www.reddit.com/user/GayHomophobe1)

## Found a bug?

If you find a bug or a mistake in any documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to GearLang. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Patch Guidelines

Here are some things that would be helpful to us.

* Write Tests
* Run tests before send Pull Request
* Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

There are some patches which are hard to write tests, e.g. doc mistakes, concurrency issues, syntax or just plain dumb decision making on my part. In such case, don't worry about it and submit a Pull Request.

***Thank You!***
