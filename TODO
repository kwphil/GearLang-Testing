# Bugs to fix

1. [ ] std_gearlang::except::UnwrapResultError
    * **Description** - The what() function throws up garbage and then core dumps
    * **Status** - Not Started
    * **Priority** - Low
    * **Notes** - Probably a better way to do it than what I did (src/result.cpp)

2. [ ] std_gearlang::token::Number::try_parse
    * **Description** - The function appears to always return Ok
    * **Status** - In Progress
    * **Priority** - High
    * **Notes** - Prolly something with string checking if I were to guess
